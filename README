Welcome to The Legend of The Village!

Firstly, thankyou for taking the time to read this readme and (hopefully) play my game.

LotV v0.2 was developped over the course of about 3 days. It's my first real project, and I'm fairly proud of it.

The game is now in .exe form! Take the entire exe.win-2.7 folder and use the Dungeon2 executable within that folder.
If you do not already have Python and Pygame, do NOT use LegendofTheVillage0.2.py.
Double-click, and it should install python & pygame for you.
If not, contact me.

Other than that, you should just be able to run the game without a problem.

Press H for instructions

Thankyou!
