Welcome to The Legend of The Village!

Firstly, thankyou for taking the time to read this readme and (hopefully) play my game.

LotV v0.2 was developped over the course of about 3 days. It's my first real project, and I'm fairly proud of it.

To play you need to have both python and pygame installed. I have tried to make a simple application for it, but without much success.
If you have any advice on making such an application, please tell me!

Other than that, you should just be able to run the game without a problem.

Press H for instructions

Thankyou!
